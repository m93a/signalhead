/**
 * Takes a signal, and produces a new signal which collects the last
 * few values of the former one into an array. The most current value
 * is always in the first one in the array, the previous value is second,
 * etc. It is similar to the NPM package `svelte-previous` or to Rust's
 * `slice::windows` method.
 *
 * As all signals are lazy, SignalWithHistory will not subscribe to
 * its dependency immediately, but only once it has any subscribers
 * itself – and will unsubscribe from its dependency once all its
 * subscribers unsubscribe. This means that historic values are not
 * tracked while there are no subscribers – if you need them, use
 * `s.withHistory().keepAlive(d)` with a suitable abort signal.
 *
 * @example
 * const a = mut(42);
 * const b = a.withHistory(3);
 *
 * a.set(69);
 * b.subscribe(console.log); // [69, 69, 69]
 * // the history was not tracked while there were no subscribers
 *
 * a.set(-12); // b: [-12, 69, 69]
 * a.set(420); // b: [420, -12, 69]
 * a.set(3); // b: [3, 420, -12]
 *
 * @see {Readable#keepAlive}
